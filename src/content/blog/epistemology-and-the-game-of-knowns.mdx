I've been circling the same feeling for a while now, and it keeps showing up no matter what I'm working on. Thinking about reasoning systems, watching agents fail in ways that feel familiar, trying to explain to someone why a belief that once felt obvious no longer does. The feeling is always the same.

Thinking does not feel like building a tower. It feels more like trying to play a game while the board is subtly shifting under you, where the rules are partly explicit, partly social, and partly only visible once you violate them.

The clean story we like to tell about knowledge is that it accumulates. You observe the world, you form beliefs, you add evidence, and over time the picture gets clearer. But when I look closely at how my own ideas actually change, that story breaks down.

What happens instead feels closer to pressure and redistribution. One claim holds for a long time, not because it is especially strong, but because nothing has pushed on it from the right angle yet. Then something small enters the picture (often a detail or an example) and the weight shifts. The claim still exists, but it no longer sits where it used to.

This is why I've started thinking about epistemology less as a theory of justification and more as a game. Not a game in the sense of entertainment, but in the sense of pieces, moves, constraints, and incentives. What matters is not just whether something is true/false, but how it is positioned inside a larger structure of beliefs, language, and expectations.

I call this the game of knowns.

The questions that keep surfacing are deceptively simple:

*How do you know?* Not as a challenge, but as a genuine probe into the structure underneath a claim. *What does not knowing mean?* Is it the absence of information, the presence of contradiction, or just the awareness that your confidence has no floor? *When does belief become knowledge, and what sets the threshold?* How confident do you have to be before you act on something, and who decides whether that confidence is warranted?

These are not separate questions. They are different angles on the same underlying structure. "How do you know?" reveals the grammar at work (the system of rules, transitions, and entitlements that gave a claim its standing). "What does not knowing mean?" probes the negative space (what your system does when it encounters gaps, ambiguity, or unresolvable tension). And confidence thresholds force the pragmatic question: at what point does a belief earn the right to drive action, and what happens when that threshold is wrong?

Every answer to "how do you know?" exposes a different set of moves: I saw it, I was told, I reasoned it out, it just seems obvious, I read it somewhere, I've always believed it. Each implies a different justification structure, different vulnerability to revision, and different conditions under which the claim might quietly stop being true. And each implies a different relationship to not-knowing (some answers leave room for uncertainty, others paper over it, and a few make it structurally impossible to express).

Knowledge, it turns out, has a grammar. Not grammar in the linguistic sense, but in the sense of an underlying system of rules that governs what counts as a valid move. What can follow from what. Which transitions are legitimate and which ones break the game. And not-knowing has a grammar too (one that most systems handle badly, because the default move is to collapse uncertainty into a false binary rather than hold it as a live state).

## The Pieces on the Board

In this game, not all knowns are the same. Some are inherited early and rarely revisited. Some are borrowed because they come packaged with authority. Others are earned through repeated contact with reality, or are just conveniences that harden into conclusions because they reduce friction. Many of them coexist without ever being tested against each other.

Philosophy has long recognized a basic division here. Some knowledge is *a priori* (it holds independently of experience). You do not need to go out into the world to know that a triangle has three sides or that if A is greater than B and B is greater than C, then A is greater than C. The justification is structural. Other knowledge is *a posteriori* (it depends on experience, on having encountered the world in specific ways). You know the coffee is hot because you touched the mug. You know that particular road floods because you have driven it in the rain.

The distinction matters because these two kinds of knowns follow different grammars. A priori knowledge resists empirical counterexample (no amount of observing triangles will change the definition). A posteriori knowledge is always provisional, always hostage to the next encounter. When we confuse the two (treating an empirical generalization as if it were a structural truth, or dismissing a logical constraint because it does not feel experiential) the game breaks in ways that are hard to diagnose.

The trouble is that knowledge and belief often look identical from the inside. And in practice, most of what we carry is not cleanly a priori or a posteriori. It is some murky blend of absorbed categories, pattern-matched experience, and social convention.

For a long time, I knew that cats do not have thumbs. This was not a carefully reasoned position. It was just part of the background. Then I met my old cat Smokey.

Smokey had polydactyl paws. Extra toes. Not opposable thumbs in the strict anatomical sense, but close enough to matter. He would cup objects, grip edges, and pick things up in ways that did not fit the category I had been carrying around. I still knew the general rule about cats. And I also knew, just as concretely, that Smokey had thumbs in the way that mattered for interacting with the world.

Nothing dramatic followed. There was no moment of revelation. But something shifted quietly. The word "know" lost some of its certainty. The category did not break, but it stopped feeling complete.

If you had asked me beforehand, *how do you know cats don't have thumbs?*, I would have struggled to answer. It was not a priori (there is no logical necessity to it). It was not the product of careful empirical study. It was just something that had settled into place without ever being tested. The question itself would have revealed how thin the justification was. That is what "how do you know?" does: it makes the grammar visible. It shows you which rules a belief is actually following, as opposed to which rules you assume it follows.

That kind of shift keeps showing up. A belief survives more because it has not been stressed than because it has been tested. A label does social/cognitive work that we mistake for accuracy. A system lacks a place to store exceptions without treating them as errors.

## World Models and State Transitions

This is where the idea of a world model becomes useful.

At any given moment, we are all carrying an internal model of how the world works. Not a list of propositions, but a structured representation shaped by experience, language, and reinforcement.

When something unexpected happens, the model can reject the input, compartmentalize it, or reorganize itself. That reorganization is rarely local. One adjustment pulls on many others.

Otto Neurath captured this with an image I keep coming back to: we are like sailors who must rebuild their ship on the open sea, never able to dismantle it in dry-dock and reconstruct it from the best materials. Every revision happens while the rest of the structure is still load-bearing. You cannot replace the whole thing at once. You patch, you reinforce, you swap out planks one at a time, and you hope the vessel holds.

This framing goes back to developmental psychology, where early work on schemas described how learning is not just accumulation but restructuring. When new experience does not fit, the internal model changes. The learner does not simply add a fact. They come to inhabit a different world.

Adult thinking follows the same pattern. We just get better at maintaining the illusion of continuity.

Seen this way, a thought is not the sentence you articulate. The sentence comes later. A thought is a state change in your world model. You were oriented one way toward reality, and now you are oriented another. Language is what leaks out after the shift has already happened.

## The False Comfort of Static Knowledge

This is why I've grown suspicious of the phrase "what I know." It implies stability and ownership. Most of what I carry is conditional.

It depends on context, on what is being optimized, on which evidence is allowed into view, and on the cost of revising a belief once it has social weight attached to it. It depends on whether the surrounding system tolerates uncertainty or quietly punishes it.

So epistemology is not only about justification. It is also about governance: who can update the shared model, under what constraints, and with what audit trail.

These questions are not new. They have been asked for thousands of years. The tools change, but the underlying tensions stay remarkably stable. If the game of knowns is going to make any sense as a framework, it needs to sit inside a longer tradition.

## The Epistemological Lineage

### The Ancients: What Is Knowledge?

The oldest version of this question comes from Plato. His dialogues (especially *Theaetetus*) test answers like perception and true belief with an account. He did not settle the matter, but he separated appearing true from being justified, and he treated inquiry as a structured activity rather than opinion exchange.

Aristotle sharpened this by distinguishing *episteme* (genuine scientific knowledge, grounded in demonstration from first principles) from *doxa* (mere opinion that might happen to be correct but lacks structural backing). Not all knowns are equal, and the difference is not in how confident you feel but in the grammar of justification behind the claim.

For over two thousand years, the dominant answer was some version of justified true belief. Then in 1963, Edmund Gettier showed you can have a belief that is both justified and true and still not count as knowledge, because the justification and the truth connect only by accident. The gap this revealed has never been closed: being justified and being right are not enough. The *way* they connect matters.

Ancient skepticism pushed in the opposite direction by turning doubt into a discipline. The skeptics were the first to take not-knowing seriously as a position rather than a failure, to recognize that your confidence can outrun your evidence, and that the honest response is sometimes suspension rather than forced closure. That pressure is still relevant for any system that must decide when to abstain.

### The Early Moderns: Where Does Justification Come From?

The early modern period produced the famous argument over where justified belief primarily comes from. Rationalists like Descartes anchored knowledge in what can be known prior to experience (structure, logic, mathematical necessity). Empiricists like Hume countered that everything substantive enters through the senses.

This is where the a priori/a posteriori distinction became a formal fault line, and where each side's grammar of justification broke in characteristic ways. Rationalism could not explain how purely structural knowledge connects to the contingent world. Empiricism could not account for necessary truths that no amount of observation could establish.

Kant's synthesis attempt remains the most productive resolution: some knowledge is *synthetic a priori* (genuinely about the world but not dependent on particular experience). The structures of space, time, and causation are not things we observe. They are the conditions under which observation becomes possible at all. Kant was answering "how do you know?" at the deepest level: some things you know because without them, experience itself would have no grammar.

This maps directly onto a tension I see in reasoning systems every day. A language model carries parameterized prior competence from training (a kind of a priori structure, baked in before any particular query arrives). A retrieval pipeline provides a posteriori evidence (external, contingent, specific to the moment). When they conflict, something has to arbitrate, and the arbitration rules are rarely made explicit.

The model priors versus retrieval evidence dispute is an updated rationalism/empiricism argument, and most teams do not realize they are having it.

### The Process Turn: How Does Inquiry Succeed or Fail?

The 19th and 20th centuries shifted the question from "what is knowledge?" to "how do inquiry processes succeed or fail?", and with it, the confidence threshold question changed shape. It was no longer just *how sure should I be?* but *what kind of process produces warranted confidence?*

Pragmatism reframed truth as something that must survive ongoing contact with reality, not something you arrive at and then preserve. Peirce added abduction (inference to the best explanation) as the move that gets inquiry started before you have enough structure for deduction or enough data for induction. Popper sharpened not-knowing into a default state: your claim is not knowledge until it has survived a serious attempt to disprove it. Kuhn showed that even the frameworks we evaluate claims *within* are subject to revolutionary replacement. When we build benchmarks and evals, we are making epistemological choices whether we name them or not.

The through-line: epistemic theory must be compatible with how finite agents actually reason. Evaluation frameworks, benchmark design, and deployment telemetry are epistemological infrastructure, whether anyone calls them that.

### The Grammar of Knowledge: Wittgenstein

And then there is Wittgenstein, whose later work changed how I think about all of this.

In *On Certainty*, he argued that "how do you know?" is not always the same question. It changes meaning depending on the context, the stakes, and the kind of claim being examined. Some propositions sit so deep in our practice that doubting them would not be a sign of rigor but of confusion (not because they are certain, but because they function as the scaffolding on which doubt itself depends).

Wittgenstein called this the *grammar* of knowledge claims. Not rules we consciously follow, but the deep structure that determines which moves make sense. You can ask "how do you know the coffee is hot?" and get a straightforward empirical answer. But "how do you know you have two hands?" is a different kind of question (not harder, but grammatically different). The justification structures are not the same. The transitions that count as valid are not the same. And confusing one grammar for another is where a lot of philosophical/engineering trouble begins.

The same applies to confidence. "I'm not sure the coffee is hot" and "I'm not sure I have two hands" are grammatically different statements even though they use the same words. The grammar tells you what kind of confidence is even relevant, and whether the question of thresholds makes sense at all.

This reframed the game of knowns for me. The game does not have one set of rules. It has multiple overlapping grammars, and part of the skill is recognizing which grammar you are operating in at any given moment.

### Contemporary Epistemology: Trust, Process, and Power

Most of the epistemology that maps directly onto AI sits in the last few decades, and I will move through it quickly because the essential insight is the same across schools: justification is never just an individual achievement.

The internalism/externalism debate asks whether justification must be accessible from the agent's own perspective or can depend on external reliability conditions. Most production systems are implicitly externalist (we trust them because of pipeline quality, not because the model can explain itself). Reliabilism formalizes this: what matters is truth-conducive *process*, not internal coherence. Virtue epistemology shifts the focus to disciplined performance by agents/communities. Social and feminist epistemology expose how power, role, and institutional structure determine what gets counted as knowledge (and who gets to say "I don't know" without penalty). Bayesian epistemology gives a mathematical language for uncertainty/updating, while bounded rationality explains why real agents deviate from those ideals under resource constraints.

For deployed agents, the question is not which school is right, but what bounded approximation we can audit and trust.

### The Pattern Across Centuries

Across all of these schools and centuries, the stable pattern looks the same. The question evolved from what knowledge is, to where justified belief comes from, to how inquiry processes succeed/fail, to how individuals/institutions co-produce epistemic quality. And now we are asking how to engineer these constraints into human-agent systems.

The three questions I started with (*how do you know?*, *what does not knowing mean?*, *what sets the confidence threshold?*) turn out to be exactly the questions each era was answering in its own terms. The vocabulary changes. The underlying tensions do not.

The live question is no longer just "is this output true?" It is: what process produced it, what evidence anchored it, who can revise it, and how quickly can we detect and correct epistemic drift?

## Knowledge Is a Social Game

Everything I have described so far (grammars, thresholds, the a priori and a posteriori) might sound like it lives inside a single mind. But grammars are never private. A grammar is, by definition, the set of rules a community enforces. The moment more than one mind is involved, knowledge becomes relational, and the game changes character.

We do not just model the world. We model each other. We carry assumptions about what others know, what they care about, what they will accept, and what kinds of updates they are likely to resist. This is theory of mind at work, whether we name it or not.

Every conversation is an attempt to align world models under uncertainty.

This is where "how do you know?" becomes not just a philosophical question but a social one. When you ask it in a meeting, a classroom, or a Slack thread, you are not just requesting a justification chain. You are probing the grammar of the community. You are asking: what counts as evidence here? What sources carry authority? What kind of update is this group willing to tolerate? The answer tells you as much about the social structure as it does about the claim itself.

Different communities develop different knowledge grammars. In a research lab, citing a replicated experiment is a valid move. In a courtroom, establishing chain of custody is. In an engineering standup, pointing to a passing test suite is. These grammars are rarely written down, but they are enforced constantly. Violating them does not just make you wrong. It marks you as someone who does not understand the game being played.

This matters because most beliefs are not revised in isolation. They are revised under social pressure. Norms, incentives, reputational costs, and shared language all shape which updates feel possible.

A belief that could change quietly inside your own head may become immovable once it is embedded in a group identity or institutional process.

Epistemology lives inside those dynamics. It is about how shared world models get updated, who is allowed to propose changes, and how conflicting pressures are reconciled without fragmenting the system.

## Reasoning Systems and the Game

This becomes even more visible when we introduce agentic reasoning systems into the mix.

Whatever position you take on consciousness, these systems already participate in the game of knowns. They track what you care about. They infer intent from context. They respond to the essence of a question, not just its surface form. That is a kind of model of mind (even if it is partial, instrumental, and derivative).

Crucially, agents do not distinguish between you and other agents the way humans do. To them, a prompt is a source of pressure. A tool call is a move. A contradiction is something to be resolved or routed around.

When multiple agents interact, they generate and reconcile conflicting signals in much the same way people do, just faster and with different failure modes.

Recent methods like chain-of-thought prompting and ReAct improve problem solving/tool use. Retrieval-augmented generation improves access to external evidence/provenance. But none of these methods, by themselves, guarantee epistemic integrity.

You still need source traceability, reproducible process logs, uncertainty calibration, contradiction handling, and governance for shared memory updates.

Reasoning text is not the same thing as epistemic grounding. A model can produce a fluent chain of reasoning that looks rigorous and still be untethered from the evidence that would make it trustworthy. The gap between "sounds like it knows" and "we can verify how it knows" is exactly where most systems fail quietly.

Try asking "how do you know?" of a language model's output. Not rhetorically; actually trace it. Where did this claim come from? Was it retrieved or generated? Is the justification a priori (following from the model's parametric knowledge) or a posteriori (grounded in specific retrieved evidence)? In most deployed systems, the answer is unclear, and there is no mechanism to make it clear. The grammar of justification is absent (not because the system lacks intelligence, but because no one built the infrastructure to make justification legible).

Interfaces matter here as much as model intelligence. An interface can force premature closure, hide uncertainty gradients, or reward clean answers over accurate hesitation.

The opposite is also true. An interface can make revision legitimate, preserve provenance, and separate confidence from fluency. When that happens, knowledge stops being a static database and becomes a living protocol between agents/tools/humans.

## The Quiet Difficulty

When agents and humans collaborate, the question is no longer just what is true, but how truth claims move through the system. How assumptions get encoded. How norms emerge. How disagreements are surfaced, suppressed, or quietly averaged away.

Without explicit mechanisms for reconciliation, the system defaults to the easiest equilibrium, not the most accurate one.

The same problems we face as individuals show up at scale. Beliefs persist because they are convenient. Exceptions get smoothed over. World models drift without anyone noticing until something breaks.

The quiet difficulty, again, is staying honest about state.

Do I believe this because it has survived contact with contradiction, or because the system makes contradiction expensive? Do I call this known because it is stable, or because neither the human nor the agent has a good way to represent unresolved tension without collapsing it?

Thinking (whether done by people, agents, or mixed systems) asks for discipline. Not the discipline of certainty, but the discipline of continued update. The ability to hold incompatible pressures long enough for a better structure to emerge.

That discipline is not just an individual virtue. It is an architectural requirement. It means building systems with explicit knowledge grammars (clear rules about what counts as evidence, what transitions are valid, how confidence is tracked, and when revision is mandatory rather than optional). It means asking "how do you know?" not once, but continuously, and building the infrastructure to make the answer legible at every layer of the system.

And it might be the real intelligence test. Not how quickly a system converges, but whether it can keep revising its shared world model without lying to itself about where the cracks are.

I keep coming back to Smokey. He did not break my world model. He just revealed that it had been running on a grammar I had never examined (a set of rules about cats and thumbs and categories that had settled into place without being tested and persisted without being earned). The shift was small. The recognition was not.

That is the quiet difficulty, stated plainly. Not the dramatic collapse of a belief system, but the slow realization that the rules were thinner than you thought, that confidence had been doing the work of knowledge, and that the honest next move is not to patch the old model but to sit with the gap long enough to see what belongs there.

Whether the system doing the sitting is a person, an agent, or something in between, the discipline is the same.

I have not read all of these cover to cover, but I have read pieces of most of them while following my own lines of interest. It is a vast field with thoughtful contributions stretching across thousands of years, and even partial contact with the tradition changes how you think about the problems.
