## Why This Exists

SemanticWiki addresses a practical engineering gap: architecture knowledge usually decays faster than code changes. The project treats documentation as a generated, verifiable artifact with direct traceability back to implementation.

<FramingCallout title="Core Thesis">
  Architectural understanding should be queryable, testable, and linked to exact source locations, not trapped in stale prose.
</FramingCallout>

## Product Surface

SemanticWiki currently ships as an AI-powered CLI with two concrete operating modes:

1. `semanticwiki generate` to produce architecture documentation and static wiki outputs.
2. `semanticwiki continue` to resume long-running autonomous documentation sessions with cached context.

```bash
semanticwiki generate -r ./my-project --site
semanticwiki generate -r ./my-project --verbose
semanticwiki continue -r ./my-project --skip-index
```

The output includes architecture overviews, module maps, data-flow docs, and getting-started guides with direct source references such as `src/auth/jwt.ts:23`.

## Product and Research Lenses

      <p>Developer-facing value comes from speed to comprehension in unfamiliar codebases.</p>
      <p>The static site output focuses on searchability, keyboard navigation, and low-friction handoff across teams.</p>

## System Architecture

SemanticWiki combines four layers:

1. Codebase exploration and structural extraction.
2. Semantic retrieval over embeddings (FAISS + all-MiniLM-L6-v2).
3. Agentic reasoning loop for documentation planning and synthesis.
4. Verification loop for source-link integrity and output consistency.

This architecture is intentionally dual-purpose: it powers a usable product and produces measurable research signals.

## Evaluation Strategy

| Metric | Definition | Failure Signal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Traceability Precision | % of documentation claims that resolve to valid source spans | Broken links, wrong file-level mappings |
| Architectural Coverage | % of core modules and interfaces represented | Missing high-centrality modules |
| Regeneration Stability | Similarity across repeated runs with same inputs | High variance across unchanged code |
| Link Drift Resilience | Integrity after codebase edits | Growing unresolved references over time |

## Research Program

Current work is less about writing prettier docs and more about formalizing documentation generation as a reliability problem:

- How does retrieval strategy alter architectural coherence?
- Which planning loops best balance speed with verification quality?
- How much autonomous execution is safe before human checkpoints are required?

Negative outcomes, such as brittle trace mapping or overconfident summaries, are tracked as first-class artifacts.

## Near-Term Direction

1. Add confidence scoring to all source-linked claims.
2. Introduce benchmark suites that stress heterogeneous mono-repos.
3. Compare planning strategies under identical retrieval corpora.
